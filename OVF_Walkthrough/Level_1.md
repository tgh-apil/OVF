> This page describes the usage and limitations of Level 1 Evaluation in accordance to the proposed framework.

### Step 1
The user must first collect relevant relevant information on the product.
> The collected data could be in the form of a webpage, article, GitHub repository, etc. 
### Step 2
One must then refer to the various disclosures and agreements for using the product or its designs. This step enables to understand the implications of replicating or modifying the said design and the implication of intellectual property and usage rights presented to its users.
### Step 3
One may then use the [Open Source Evaluation Framework (Level 1)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PRt2HC2-uN83t6KabfaPh7HkiB3NAqHicmlWIqqOg7Q/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110063970478845364701) in order to ensure that the said project contains all the relevant information which may be required to successfully replicate or modify in realtime.

### Limitations 

- The usage of Level 1 Evaluation enables one to understand the resources and the extent to which one could sucessfully use the project for their own purposes. 

- This level of evaluation is only a surface level assessment of these resources and fails to account for the integrity and the accuracy of the information provided by the authors of their respective projects.
