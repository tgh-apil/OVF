# Open Emergency Use Ventilator Evaluation Framework Database Structure

[Open Emergency Use Ventilator Evaluation Framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZCyhApbfuuTKdAJZoyu9oNsZNAQVqM0uN2yYx3lXxI/edit#gid=2143777926) 

The database is currently stored in spreadsheet format and linked to the project repository. The "Open Emergency Use Ventilator Evaluation Framework” spreadsheet is divided into categories and levels of evaluation. To navigate, the user may choose to review specific category such as: ventilation, risk, human factors, infection control, mechanical, electrical or software systems, open source, general, and testing requirements. Furthermore, a selection can be made regarding what regulatory compliance documentation the user prefers to follow under the evaluation procedure. For example, selecting only MHRA/TGA requirements or multiple regulatory standards such as EUV (AAMI), MHRA/TGA, HC, and FDA all at once. 

The **“Description”** column provides a general description of the regulatory requirement or testing specification. 

The **“Priority”** section allows the user to identify or sort through the level of priority, in which case ‘must', ‘should’, ‘could’ and ‘N/A’ are all available options. 

Finally, the **“Standards Reference”** section provides citations to all relevant standards and clauses that the user should follow in order to retrieve complete information about the “Description” of the regulatory requirement of interest. 

**NOTE:** It is the user’s responsibility to obtain all regulatory documents in order to comply with international standards and requirements. The proposed repository acts only as part of the evaluation framework and does not provide details description of all requirements that the user might want to review to achieve full compliance.
