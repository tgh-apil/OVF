# 2.2.1.4. TGA (AUS) 

The TGA has also addressed the shortage of these devices and has issued a [public notice](https://www.tga.gov.au/behind-news/ventilators-and-other-devices-intended-respiratory-support-covid-19) for the
emergency relief of health care officials. 

The [specifications](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/ventilator-covid-19-use-australia.pdf) are closely knit with those mentioned by the MHRA. Several exemptions have been made for the encouragement of [domestic manufacturing](https://www.tga.gov.au/exemption-enable-domestic-manufacture-and-supply-ventilators#manufacturing) of these devices. One can find several checklists and templates for the easy fulfillment and evaluation in accordance to these
requirements.
