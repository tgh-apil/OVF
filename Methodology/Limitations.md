# 2.4 Limitations

It is important to note a number of limitations that are associated with the regulatory assessment of the emergency ventilator designs shared via open source platforms. To fully evaluate the design and develop it to a point of regulatory approval, the user must be able to collect all materials necessary to produce a full build. Therefore, it is important to note that **Level 1 and 2** of the proposed evaluation framework can be applied to compare a number of designs that are shared publicly. The first two levels of evaluation can be used in situations where the user is interested in identifying which ventilator design can be pursued for future research and development purposes. 

Furthermore, some documentation that has been used for the synthesis of all mandatory requirements have been collected from the international regulatory documents that are protected by the copyright. Therefore, use of the database discussed in **Section 3** of this document must be used as a guide only and in conjunction with the documents that comply with the jurisdiction on userâ€™s interest. In which case, when necessary, the user must purchase all relevant ISO/IEC standards in order to complete the regulatory compliance.
