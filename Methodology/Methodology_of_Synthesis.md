# 2.3. Methodology of Synthesis

### Open Source Design Evaluation Framework: Overview of Currently Available Regulatory Guidelines on Emergency Ventilation Systems
Proposed evaluation framework was derived from the extensive review of existing regulatory agency guidelines on emergency ventilation systems. We started off by revising information available on the official Health Canada, FDA, MHRA, TGA websites, specifically paying close attention to the guidelines released under the interim order and those applicable to the pandemic situation. Close revision allowed us to track down references to ISO, IEC, EUA, EUV and AAMI documents that specify standards and testing requirements for various portable, stationary, ICU and emergency ventilation systems. All standards have been documented in an Excel to help us generate a summary of documents that need to be procured and revised for the information synthesis. It is important to note that all documents that have been considered for the development of the proposed assessment framework are presented in English and are further discussed below.  

**Health Canada Interim Order (IO)** for the promotion of the rapid development of emergency use medical devices and accessories during COVID-19. Which provides specifications for the scaled down ventilators and ICU ventilators were also released for a general overview of the developers. 

The **FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)** which provides a set of guidelines towards the modification and development of emergency use ventilators. It also issued a letter of authorization for manufacturers to conform with the said practices to ensure device’s usability. 

Similarly, under the emergency, certain exemptions have been made by the **MHRA**. A comprehensive list of specifications has been released for reference. Providing the guidance towards various regulatory requirements for manufacturers. 

The **TGA** has also issued a public notice for the emergency relief of health care officials. Their specifications are closely knit with those mentioned by the MHRA. Several exemptions have then been made for the encouragement of domestic manufacturing of these devices. One can find several checklists and templates for the easy fulfillment and evaluation in accordance to these requirements. 

The **Medical Equipment Compliance Associates (MECA)** have made available a very detailed set checklists for evaluation, risk management, labeling and alarm requirements. It also provides guidance towards the evaluation of critical components for the ventilator design. 

Finally, the **Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)** formed a consensus report in lieu of the pandemic for the development of **Emergency Use Ventilators (EUV)**. The report guides one through the limitations and extent of the application of the General Standard and the ventilation standards of *“80601-2-80: Medical Electrical Equipment - Part 2-80: Particular Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance of Ventilatory Support Equipment for Ventilatory Insufficiency.”* The organization provided an End User Disclosure guidance document and a draft of Test Report for emergency ventilators.

Our team performed a detailed review and developed a complete list of all regulatory standards in the handbook format that provides explanation about the use and purpose of said regulations. 

### Open Source Design Evaluation Framework: Terminology. 

One other distinction that we have made early on, pertains to the classification of regulatory requirements in the abovementioned documents. For example, under the interim order, requirements have bene classified into categories of ***“must”***, ***“should”*** and ***“could”*** in the MHRA documentation. With ***“must”*** defining minimum viable product requirements acceptable by clinicians, ***“should”*** representing highly desirable features that enhance therapeutic benefits, and ***“could”*** representing features that are desirable but not mandatory as they do not significantly impede or enhance the performance of the system. 

Similarly, the ISO regulations use auxiliary verbs to define levels of mandated requirements. 

>**As stated by the ISO:** *“For the purposes of the document, the auxiliary verb: “shall” - means that conformance with a requirement or a test is mandatory for conformance with this document; “should” - means that conformance with a requirement or a test is recommended but is not mandatory for conformance with this document; “may” - is used to describe permission (e.g. a permissible way to achieve conformance with a requirement or test); "can" - is used to describe a possibility or capability; and "must" is used to express an external constraint.”*

To synthesize information relevant to the assessment of regulatory conformance of emergency ventilation systems with all relevant international standards, we have distilled information from acquired standards based on its “mandatory” requirement status. Meaning that desired or recommended features that are not essential to the safety and performance of such system have been purposefully excluded from the proposed evaluation framework. To further consolidate information, we have decided to break down the assessment framework into three distinct levels described in the following section.
