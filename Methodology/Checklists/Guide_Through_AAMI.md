# 2.2.3.2. Guide Through AAMI

The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) formed a consensus report in lieu of the pandemic for the development of [Emergency Use Ventilators (EUV)](https://www.aami.org/docs/default-source/standardslibrary/200410_cr501-2020_rev1-2.pdf?sfvrsn=699e62b7_2).

The report guides one through the limitations and extent of the application of the GS and the
ventilation standards of “80601-2-80: Medical Electrical Equipment - Part 2-80: *Particular Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance of Ventilatory Support Equipment for Ventilatory Insufficiency.”*

The organization has also provided an [End User Disclosure](https://www.aami.org/docs/default-source/standardslibrary/200417_cr502-2020_rev1-2.pdf?sfvrsn=72e5fc61_2) guidance document and a draft of [Test Report](https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=21187586&objAction=browse&viewType=1) for emergency ventilators.
