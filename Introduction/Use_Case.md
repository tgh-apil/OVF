The assumed end user is a hospital or governmental healthcare system administration personnel interested in performing a systemic evaluation of device options for clinical deployment during a pandemic. Proposed evaluation framework will act as a guide for identification of critical problems that remain unaddressed across any emergency ventilation system project of interest.
 
For emergency ventilation systems research and development projects the proposed evaluation framework must act as a guide to help identify and prioritize deficiencies of a given project and create the roadmap to address them. Evaluated devices may then be compared in terms of relative progress and device preparedness level.
